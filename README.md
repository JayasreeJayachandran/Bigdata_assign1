1.Various sources of Big Data:
   Big data is used in various field such as:
       1.Banking
       2.Education
       3.Healthcare
       4.Government
       5.Security
       6.Manufacturing
       7.Retail
       8.Media

2. 3 V's of Big Data:
  1.Volume- the size of data stored
  2.Velocity-the speed at which the data is acquired
  3.Variety- we can include any kind of unstructured,structure and semi structured data.
  
3. Horizontal Scaling and Vertical Scaling
   1.Horizontal Scaling: In this the data is divided into small scale and distributed over a wide range,so that the processing 
   will speed up.
   2.Vertical Scaling: In this the data storing capacity of the storage is increased,so that it can store a huge data.
   
4.Need and Working of Hadoop:
  Need:   In big data we need to process unstructured data which is not possible in RDBMS so to process such data we need a framework
  that accepts huge amount of data and process it to give the required output but also requires original data remains unchanged for 
  future use.
  Working:  It consist of two system 
          1.HDFS:Hadoop distributed File System stores the data in a wide range of machine to be cost effective and to be reliable.
          2.Mapreduce engine:This helps to process the data into crisp information such that it can be used effectively.
